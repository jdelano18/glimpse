#  TODOs:

### Figure out how to do sample data question with answers linked
* Im stuck on doing this. not sure how. but it makes it a real pita when my sample questions filter out the answers and there are none on the preview
* this has to be done next its super annoying and i'm stuck on it rn
* might be able to do without bc now were just building it but seems silly

### GlimpseDetailView dates arent lining up after filtering by correct question.
* *sigh*
* ForEach<Array<String>, String, ModifiedContent<Text, _FrameLayout>>: the ID S occurs multiple times within the collection, this will give undefined results! -- each time this view is selected
* also, the text gets cut off at the top for the metrics
